    "# Classes as decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, decorators can be either functions or classes. In both cases, decorating adds functionality to existing functions. When we decorate a function with a class, that function becomes an instance of the class. We can add functionality to the function by defining methods in the decorating class. This can all be achieved without modifying the original function source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will demonstrate how classes can be used to decorate the functions we write in our Python code. Two use-cases will be showcased, namely: decorating a function with a Class that accepts no arguments, and decorating a function with a class than can accept arguments. If no arguments are passed, our class will fall back to a default value.\n",
    "I have specifically simplified the examples presented to aid understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Similar outcomes could be achieved using alternative, simpler approaches, but my purpose overall in this tutorial is to demonstrate how we can use classes to decorate functions and extend their functionality.\n",
    "This tutorial was also motivated to showcase how to use decorated classes which can accept arguments themselves."

    "## The multiple together function\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple together function is designed to take two integer values, multiply them together and return their output. Let's consider the scenario, where we would like to add some extra functionality to this function without changing its original source code. Here, would we like to square the returned value? We can achieve this using a class decorator.\n",
    "To decorate a function with a class, we must use the @syntax followed by our class name above the function definition. Following convention, we will use camel-case for our class name. In the class definition, we define two methods: the init constructor and the magic (or dunder) call method.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we decorate a function with a class, the function is automatically passed as the first argument to the init constructor. We set this function as an attribute in our object. If we print multiply_together now, we can see it is an instance of the Power class.\n",
    "By defining the __call__() method, we can call multiply together as you could with the original function. Here, we can see that we multiply 2 by 2 and square the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the call method, which requires two arguments (specified because our original multiply together function required two arguments), we call the multiply together function with these two arguments. This function has been set as self._arg in the object.attribute syntax below. We call this function with two values passed and save the returned value to the variable retval. Finally, we square retval and return the value."

The function is then passed as the only argument when we define the call method.\n",

    "Therefore if the length of the arguments passed to the call method is equal to 1, as would be the case if we pass a decorator argument to the class, this first argument to the call method will be set as the function. We can then define an inner function inside the call method that takes two arguments, a and b. The call method returns the wrapper function if the length of the arguments passed to call is 1, and we can call this function with two values passed and finally multiple it by the integer (stored under the attribute _arg) that was originally passed to the class as an argument (see example below).\n",
